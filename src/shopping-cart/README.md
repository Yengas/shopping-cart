# shopping-cart
This is the pure business logic package, for the shopping cart implementation. It is stored as a separate folder to isolate everything related to the implementation(class definitions, constants, tests), so it may be shared/moved to somewhere else, and it will be easier to differentiate the code related to business logic from the interface/dao code.
